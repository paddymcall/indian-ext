#+AUTHOR: Patrick McAllister

This package provides extensions to the standard Emacs ind-util.el
functions.


It is currently focused on providing methods for Sanskrit, but that
might (and hopefully will) change in the future.

It defines the following extra decode/encode functions:


- between Velthuis and Devanāgarī:
  - `indian-ext-dev-velthuis-encode-region'
  - `indian-ext-dev-velthuis-decode-region'
- between SLP1 and Devanāgarī:
  - `indian-ext-dev-slp1-encode-region'
  - `indian-ext-dev-slp1-decode-region'
- between IAST and Devanāgarī:
  - `indian-ext-dev-iast-encode-region'
  - `indian-ext-dev-iast-decode-region'

The IAST and Velthuis are not case sensitive.

It also defines an additional input method, sanskrit-iast (use with
`M-x set-input-method').

You can find other input methods here:
